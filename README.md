Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of my projects. Below there ara SQL and Python projects, including data visualization I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-demetradze/) if you have any feedback or questions.
## Projects
1. ### [Customer Shopping Trends Analysis](https://github.com/MikeDemetr/portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Shopping%20Trends%20Analysis) - SQL:
I conducted an analysis of customer shopping patterns using a dataset that included customer details, purchase records and interaction history. This project involved using SQL queries to extract insights, from the dataset.

- Explored customer demographics by analyzing age distribution and gender balance.
- Identified the most popular product categories to inform marketing and inventory decisions.
- Segmented customers based on age and gender for targeted marketing strategies.
- Analyzed how customer interactions varied with the seasons to optimize seasonal campaigns.
- Examined the distribution of review ratings to assess customer satisfaction.
- Determined which product categories were most popular in different locations, aiding localized strategies.
- Explored how review ratings varied by age group for targeted marketing efforts.
- Analyzed the impact of subscription programs on average purchase amounts, providing insights into program effectiveness.
  

2. ### [The Yellow Umbrella: Exploring HIMYM Episode Ratings](https://github.com/MikeDemetr/portfolio/blob/main/The%20Yellow%20Umbrella%3A%20Exploring%20HIMYM%20Episode%20Ratings) - Python:
I undertook a data analysis project aimed at exploring and uncovering insights from a dataset related to the popular television series "How I Met Your Mother" (HIMYM). The primary objectives of this project were to understand the factors influencing episode ratings and viewership trends over time.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I carefully cleaned and prepared the dataset, ensuring it was free of any missing information and that all data was consistent and reliable. This step was crucial in setting the stage for the rest of the analysis.
- Director and Writer Analysis: I delved deep into understanding how directors and writers influenced the ratings of episodes. By categorizing and examining the data, I pinpointed the directors and writers who were associated with the highest-rated episodes in the series.
- Season and Episode Trends: I investigated how the ratings from viewers (IMDb ratings) and viewership changed throughout different seasons and individual episodes. This analysis allowed me to spot trends and identify seasons and specific episodes that stood out in terms of audience reception.
- Time Series Analysis: Using the "DateAired" column, I conducted an analysis that tracked how viewership and IMDb ratings evolved over the course of the series. This analysis helped identify recurring patterns and long-term trends, allowing me to draw meaningful conclusions.
- Correlation Analysis: I explored how IMDb ratings were related to viewership and the number of votes cast by viewers. This analysis revealed important insights into how these key metrics interacted with each other.
- Presentation and Visualization: To make my findings accessible and engaging for a wide audience, I created clear and visually appealing summaries. These summaries effectively conveyed the story of the analysis, ensuring that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could understand and appreciate the insights.

3. ### [World IQ Report](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.demetradze/viz/WorldIQReport/Dashboard2?publish=yes) - Tableau.

* Data: [Worldwide Average IQ Levels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/worldwide-average-iq-levels)
* Audience: Anyone interested in geography & culture
* Purpose: Explore and interact with visualized world IQ data

I created a dashboard using the 'Worldwide Average IQ' dataset, which ranks IQ scores from different countries over various years. The dashboard allows users to explore a world map and compare IQ scores across nations. It's a tool designed for those curious about global intelligence trends and offers an easy way to see how countries stack up against the global average.
